The ambition of this full-day AMV2018 workshop is to bring together practitioners and researchers from different disciplines related to Advanced Machine Vision to share ideas and methods on current and future use of computer vision algorithms in real-life and industrially relevant systems. This field raises the need of applied research that focusses on the technology transfer from academics towards practitioners, yielding several challenges like top-notch accuracies, real-time processing, minimal training data, minimal manual input, user-friendly interfaces, &amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>We are proud to present the 1st International Workshop on Advanced Machine Vision for Real-life and Industrially Relevant Applications (AMV2018). This workshop is in conjunction with ACCV2018, Perth, Australia and is scheduled on Monday the 3rd of December 2018 (all-day workshop).
A large variety of industrially oriented applications (e.g. quality control, pick and place) have in the past decades been successfully implemented throughout a wide range of industries. These implementations are characterized by very controlled surroundings and objects (e.</description>
